### Minor Applied Quantum Computing 

Portfolio optimization with quantum annealing. Main goal is to find the optimum solution through different annealing schedules. 

## Portfolio optimization
Rebalacing the combination of asset investment to maximize its return while minimizing its risk. Selecting the best portfolio out of a bunch of portfolios. Input data can be uniform random historical price data, a budget and a risk tolerance. 

## Quantum Annealing
Quantum annealing is similar to classical or simulated annealing, where thermal fluctuations allow
the system to jump between different local minima in the energy landscape. The energy landscape consists of peaks and valleys. The system is allowed to be manipulated in a way that causes the system to tunnel its way through the peaks and find its way to what may be the lowest energy state. This effect is called Quantum Tunneling.
